## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Queries
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learned the 
```css 
object-fit:
``` 
css property and how to use 
```css 
position: relative
```
. 

### Continued development

Until now, I did not realised how important it could be to tink responsive from the start. Also, I focused on using selectors combinations instead of unnecessary id. 

### Useful resources

- [Object-fit property](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - I discovered this property here. Developer Mozilla has always been realy useful to me.

## Acknowledgments

I really used @Nadine-Green advice on the first solution I submited. I added a lang attribute to the html tag and I used a main tag instead of a div element. And I'm still learning !
